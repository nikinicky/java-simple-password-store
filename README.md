# java-simple-password-store

> This repository was created to complete an assignment for my *Object Oriented Programming* subject.

This project is a simple CLI-based password manager built to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It includes basic features like password encryption, user input handling, and saving data to a CSV file.

## How to Run

Make sure you are inside the project directory in your terminal, then run the following command:

```bash
java *.java
```

This will compile and run all Java files in the project.


## Progress Summary

### Practice 3
- Implemented a basic class to **encrypt and decrypt passwords**.

### Practice 4
- Created a simple CLI interface with three pages:
  - **Main Page**
  - **Input Page** (for adding new passwords)
  - **List Page** (to view saved passwords)

### Practice 5
- Added functionality to **save password data to a CSV file** for persistence.
